<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Samarth. I am a First Year BCA (FYBCA) student studying at Indira University.</p>
<p>I am learning web development and have basic knowledge of HTML.
I have successfully completed two beginner-level projects: a Movie Ranking Project and a Birthday Invitation Project, where I used HTML to structure web pages and present content clearly. These projects helped me understand fundamental web design concepts and improved my interest in coding.
I am motivated to learn new technologies and continuously improve my programming skills.</p>
